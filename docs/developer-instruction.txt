Here is a detailed technical implementation instruction for the NESA-Africa Sign-Up Flow with Profile Differentiation, Wallet Embedding, Bonus Assignment, and Chapter Auto-Assignment – structured for your frontend and backend developers:

🛠️ Developer Instruction Document – Sign-Up Flow Implementation (NESA-Africa Platform)
✅ 1. GOAL
Implement a dynamic, AI-guided multi-role sign-up system that:

Differentiates between 16 user profile types

Classifies by Account Type (Individual, NGO, School, Corporation, etc.)

Auto-generates embedded GFA Wallet

Assigns AGC bonus (AfriGold Coin)

Auto-maps users to their Local Online Chapter

Triggers onboarding for Ambassadors, Volunteers, and Organizational Accounts

🧩 2. SIGN-UP FORM STRUCTURE
Frontend Requirements
Form: Split into 4 or 5 dynamic steps (multi-step form)

Conditional fields based on account type

Use validation rules (real-time)

Show progress bar or step counter

Step-by-Step Breakdown
Step 1: Select Account Type (Required)
AccountType = ["Individual", "NGO", "Corporation", "Government", "School", "Diaspora Group"];
Use radio buttons or dropdown; this determines next fields dynamically.

Step 2: User Intent/Purpose (Checkboxes)
[
  "Vote or Nominate",
  "Apply for Scholarship",
  "Become Ambassador",
  "Join Webinar/Expo",
  "Sponsor or CSR Partner",
  "Join a Local Chapter",
  "Join NESA Team (Volunteer, Intern)"
]
Capture in initial_profile_purpose[] → Used to pre-filter dashboard and AGC bonus.

Step 3A: Personal Info (If Individual)
Full Name

Email

Phone (WhatsApp preferred)

Gender

Date of Birth

Country

State/Region

Preferred Language

Create Password

Step 3B: Institutional Info (If NGO, Corporation, etc.)
Org/School Name

Registration Number

Type of Entity

Contact Person Name

Contact Email + Phone

Country / Region

Upload Verification Docs (PDF/IMG)

📌 Use field toggling and state-based rendering for conditional sections

Step 4: Role Assignment (Optional if Volunteer, Staff, Intern)
Division Selector:

["SOBCD", "OMBDD", "TDSD", "LSC"]
Function Selector (multi-select):

["Media", "Sponsorship", "Legal", "Tech", "Compliance", "Field Team"]
Step 5: Auto-Assign Local Chapter
Based on country and state/region, map to:

OnlineLocalChapters table → lookup `chapter_id`
Save chapter_id to profile.

🔐 3. BACKEND FUNCTIONALITY
a. User Profile Table Design
users (
  id, name, email, phone, gender, dob, password, country, state,
  account_type, profile_type, initial_purpose[], division_id, role_tags[],
  chapter_id, wallet_id, agc_balance, referrer_id, created_at, updated_at
)
b. Wallet Creation Trigger
Use GFA Wallet API to create wallet upon registration.

Wallet ID returned and linked to wallet_id in users.

c. Assign AGC Bonus Logic
if profile_type == "Free Member":
  agc = 1
if "Ambassador" in intent:
  agc = 5
if NGO or Org:
  agc = 0 (Bonus based on later engagement)
Call:

POST /wallets/:id/bonus
{
  user_id, agc_amount, reason: "signup_bonus"
}
d. Auto Referral Setup
If coming via referral: assign referrer_id

Auto-generate referral_link: /invite/:usercode

📤 4. POST-SIGNUP REDIRECTS
If user came from...	Redirect To
Nominate	Nomination form (now unlocked)
Vote	Voting interface (now enabled)

 GFA Wallet embedded API triggers

 AGC bonus calculator engine

 Referral tracking system

Absolutely. Here's how to integrate both withdrawable and non-withdrawable AGC bonuses into the sign-up flow and wallet architecture, with instructions for developers:

🔁 AGC Bonus System: Withdrawable vs Non-Withdrawable
🪙 1. Bonus Types
Bonus Type	Description	Can Be Withdrawn?	Use Cases
Non-Withdrawable	Platform-use only. Locked for internal use like voting, nomination, webinars	❌ No	Voting, nomination, registration rewards
Withdrawable	Can be converted to cash and paid to local account (after certain actions)	✅ Yes	Referral rewards, campaign conversions
🧩 2. Wallet Schema Adjustment
Update wallet model to handle both balances:

wallets (
  id,
  user_id,
  agc_withdrawable_balance DECIMAL,
  agc_locked_balance DECIMAL,
  currency_equivalent_balance DECIMAL,
  last_updated TIMESTAMP
)
📥 3. When Bonuses Are Assigned
Trigger Event	Type Assigned	Amount	Notes
New Signup	Non-Withdrawable AGC	1–3	Based on role selection
Referral (User signs up & completes profile)	Withdrawable AGC	2–5	Tracked to referrer
Nomination Submission	Non-Withdrawable	1	Must use to nominate another
Voting Action	Non-Withdrawable	1	Bonus per vote (capped)
Referral conversion (e.g., upgrade)	Withdrawable	3–10	If nominee upgrades to member/ambassador
Event Attendance (e.g., webinars)	Non-Withdrawable	5	Can only use to vote/apply/sponsor school
Ambassador Campaign Milestone	Withdrawable	Variable	Paid out on reaching thresholds
🔐 4. Access Control in UI
Display both balances in dashboard:

🏦 Wallet:
- AGC for Use: 4 (non-withdrawable)
- AGC Cash Bonus: 2 (withdrawable)
Only show withdraw button when:

KYC is completed

Minimum payout threshold is met (e.g., 10 AGC)

User has local bank account or Momo account verified

🧾 5. API Instruction for Devs
a. Create Wallet
POST /wallets
{
  user_id: UUID,
  agc_locked_balance: 3,
  agc_withdrawable_balance: 0
}
b. Assign Bonus
POST /wallets/bonus
{
  user_id,
  type: "non-withdrawable" or "withdrawable",
  amount,
  trigger: "signup", "referral", "campaign"
}
c. Withdraw Request
POST /wallets/withdraw
{
  user_id,
  amount,
  currency: "NGN",
  destination_account: {...}
}
🎁 6. Admin Settings & Control
Admin can:

Configure bonus triggers and amounts

Approve/decline withdrawal requests

Download CSV of referral payout data

View wallet usage analytics

💡 7. Onboarding Messaging (UX)
🎉 “You’ve received 3 AGC – 2 for Voting & Nomination (Non-withdrawable), and 1 AGC Cash Bonus for referring Jane!”

💸 “Your wallet is eligible for cash withdrawal once you’ve earned 10 AGC from referrals or campaigns. Track your progress in the dashboard.”

Excellent — you're describing a "progressive, task-first onboarding system" where users can immediately engage in public actions like nomination, voting, or donation, but are prompted to sign up or sign in at the final step to complete the action or receive recognition/rewards.

Here’s the full system design based on your direction:

🌍 NESA-Africa Progressive Sign-Up Framework
(Task-First Access, Profile-Completion Required at Final Step)
✅ Core Idea
Users can start performing tasks (90%) without signing up, but must sign in/sign up to:

Save or submit final actions

Earn AGC bonuses

Get a certificate or receipt

Track or manage activity

Appear on leaderboard

🧱 What Users Can Do Without Full Sign-Up (90% Access)
Task	Allowed Without Sign-Up?	Notes
✅ View nominees	YES	Public access
✅ Begin a nomination	YES	But need to sign in before final submission
✅ Cast a vote	YES	Can choose nominee, preview vote; must sign up to submit
✅ Make a donation	YES	Can enter amount and proceed to pay; receipt tied to account only if signed up
✅ Attend a webinar	YES	Join as guest; need login for AGC rewards or certificate
✅ View sponsor/campaign pages	YES	Full public view
❌ Access ambassador dashboard	NO	Requires login
❌ Join chapter or refer someone	NO	Requires sign-in
❌ Claim AGC wallet bonuses	NO	Requires account & wallet ID
❌ View nomination history or downloads	NO	Locked behind profile
🔐 Trigger Points for “Sign-Up to Continue” (Final 10%)
Each public task ends with a “soft wall” like:

🎯 “Almost done! To complete this action and unlock rewards, please sign in or create an account.”

🔽 Examples:
Voting CTA:

“You selected Nominee A. To cast your vote and receive your AGC receipt, sign in or register below.”

Nomination CTA:

“Your form is complete! To submit and be recognized as a nominator, please log in or create your profile.”

Donation CTA:

“Thanks for your generous donation. Sign in now to get your official digital certificate and chapter recognition.”

🧠 User Flow – Progressive Access
1. User clicks “Nominate” or “Vote”
2. Fills 90% of the form
3. At submission: "Sign up to finalize"
4. Redirects to simplified role-based signup
5. Wallet is created, chapter assigned
6. Action is recorded and user is returned to confirmation screen
🛠️ If the user was logged in, no interruption occurs.

🛠️ Technical Implementation
🔹 Frontend
Soft validation via React/Vue middleware

Task progress state saved temporarily (in sessionStorage or cookies)

Dynamic modal: Sign Up / Sign In (popup or redirect)

🔹 Backend
Pre-action cache: Save pending nomination or vote

On signup:

Resume from previous task

Assign user to chapter

Credit AGC to wallet

Log full metadata: IP, location, action

💰 Bonus Incentives (Upon Completing Sign-Up)
Trigger	Bonus
Voting Completion	2 AGC
First Nomination	5 AGC
First Donation	Digital Certificate + AGC
Webinar Attendance (Logged in)	3 AGC + auto certificate
🎯 Why This Works
Increases conversion from casual visitors to full users

Doesn’t block first-time users with forms

Creates incentive to complete sign-up organically

Encourages wallet use, chapter engagement, and loyalty

🔐 Example Micro-CTA Messages
“Almost Done – One Last Step!”

“Finish Your Action & Claim Your AGC Bonus”

“Sign Up to Earn Rewards and Track Your Impact”

“Be Counted! Finalize Your Vote or Nomination”

🏗️ Database Considerations
guest_sessions: Temporarily stores anonymous actions

action_drafts: Stores nominations, votes, or donations before signup

Upon signup: Merges with new user_id

✅ Summary
Feature	Description
Task-First Access	Let users do 90% of public actions
Final Submission Wall	Ask to sign up at final 10%
Dynamic Sign-Up	Embedded based on task type
Wallet + Chapter Auto-Link	Embedded at signup
Resume Task After Signup	User returns exactly where they left off
AGC + Rewards	Drives conversion and repeat use
Great. Here's how to enhance the NESA-Africa signup system so that every new user is automatically assigned to an online local chapter based on their country and region — seamlessly integrated into the wallet system and dashboard.

🌍 Auto-Assignment to Online Local Chapter at Signup
✅ Goal:
From the moment a user signs up, the system should:

Identify their geographical location

Assign them to a corresponding online local chapter

Unlock chapter-related features in their dashboard

Embed chapter-specific wallet routing

🛠️ Updated Signup Flow: Final Step Enhancement
🖼️ STEP 6: Auto-Chapter Assignment (Behind the Scenes)
🧠 Based on:

Selected country and region/state

Role or engagement type (if applicable)

🗂️ System automatically:

Assigns user to the default Online Local Chapter for that region

Links them to the correct Chapter Wallet

Adds user to chapter leaderboard, mailing list, and community space

🖥️ System Logic (Simplified)
IF user.country == 'Kenya' AND user.state == 'Nairobi':
   assign_to_chapter = 'NESA Online Chapter – Kenya (Nairobi Region)'
ELSE IF user.country == 'Nigeria' AND user.state == 'Lagos':
   assign_to_chapter = 'NESA Online Chapter – Nigeria (Lagos Zone)'
🧾 Also:

chapter_id is saved to user profile

Used to display chapter-specific tasks, campaigns, and rewards

🧳 GFA Wallet Integration by Chapter
Mechanism	Description
🔐 Wallet Ledger Routing	Each user’s transactions (votes, donations) are logged with chapter_id for analytics and revenue tracking
🧾 Chapter-Level Reports	Each chapter leader sees wallet flows, engagement levels
💸 Referral + Campaign Rewards	Earned AGC by ambassadors reflects in their chapter wallet
🧭 User Dashboard – Chapter Area
After sign-up, users see:

Welcome to your Chapter:
NESA Online Chapter – Ghana | Greater Accra
🔹 View Chapter News
🔹 Join Ambassador Team
🔹 See Top Contributors
🔹 Contribute to Chapter Projects
🔹 View Chapter Wallet Impact (AGC)

🔐 Chapter Table Structure (Backend)
